This is an addon for blender and a package for Unity to ease the creation of worlds in VRChat.
The tool should also be expandable to other usages, for example exporting for Godot in the future.

At this time everything should be considered unstable and subject to change.

This addon functions by providing a Blender addon that exports an xml description file beside the .fbx file exported for Unity. There is a Unity addon that will read this new xml file and add or remove components as neccisary from the objects while they are getting imported.

The objects also have materials made for them so that they can have non-trivial materials that are reliable found.
